# '''Time Travelling...'''

Time travelling may be defined as the travel in time i.e past and future. But how it is possible ? How we can travel in time ? Is it really a truth that we can see our past or future ? Hold on guys...All these questions will be answered in this article.

## '''Concept of time travelling :-'''

The concept of time travelling arises on the basis of theory of relativity and law of conservation. Basically , on earth how do we define time. How do we calculate our age and hours  and minutes and seconds etc. 

Scientists give the definition of years and days and hours and minutes and seconds.

An year may be defined as a time required by a planet to revolve around its main star which is called sun. In the case of earth , it is 364.25 days. That's why ours calendars have every 4th years as leap year.

A day may be defined as the time taken by a planet to revolve around its own axis. And in case of earth , it is 24 hours.

An hour may be defined as a set of 60 minutes and a minute consist of 60 seconds.

In our solar system , there are 9 planets and every planet have different value of time due to the difference in rotation time around their axis and sun.

These differences in time in other planets is the core concept of time travelling.

## '''Time Travelling in deep :-''' 

Actually , according to the scientists calculations , there are around 10^11 galaxies and in every galaxy , there are 10^11 stars and solar system. So , according to Stephen Hawking , there must be a galaxy like our galaxy named "Milky Way" whose time is slower than our time. That means we are the future of that particular galaxy which is going behind us. And there must be a galaxy which time is ahead of us. That means that particular galaxy is the future of us and we are past of it. If we want to see our past then we need to contact that particular galaxy or star or that particular planet which is copy of our planet but is far behind us. Same concept apply on the future galaxy. If we want to see our future , then we need to contact that particular galaxy or planet which is far ahead of us in terms of time. 

Scientists describe two ways to contact to those two co-existential world. One is "Black Hole"  and another is "Worm Hole". 

## ''Worm Hole'' : - worm holes may be defined as tiny holes present on the surface of the object as every surface is not a smooth surface and have some holes on it. Through these holes we get a tunnel connecting to the other world in which we want to go.

## ''Black Hole'' :- Black hole form when a star die having so much gravitational force in it that light cannot escape.

## '''Time travelling through Worm Hole :-'''

Now , lets understand the concept of contacting to past world or future world through worm hole.

Imaginating about the universe , Hawking may thought that celestial object have some holes as every surface is not that much smooth not to carry a single hole and to pass on from one celestial body to another and they are large enough to get into by us i.e. they are large enough so that we can enter into them but small enough according to that celestial object as we are very small even smaller or smaller than the universe.
And these holes are called worm holes which are connecting two celestial bodies with a tunnel through which we can travel and meet our past and future. 
Actually , this can be understand with the example of ant and two rooms. Suppose there are two rooms located adjacently representing two galaxies of universe. the objects placed in both rooms can be supposed as the celestial bodies which have space between them. And Plot in which the rooms constructed is space. Now, an ant want to go from one room to another room which represent human beings like us in the universe. Then , she can do it by passing through the hole on the wall which is common in these rooms. And that particular hole is a worm hole which can be seen from both sides of room and the path is called tunnel.

This is the way to enter into two galaxies through worm hole.

## '''Time Travel Through black Hole :- '''

Now, how we can enter into another galaxy through black hole? Any guesses... hmm...

Do you really have any guesses or any idea how can we enter into another galaxy or the same co- existential world. Actually, I don't want to tell my idea to anyone as when I tried to tell people about the time travelling concept , a lot of people made fun of me in my collage as well as in the interview as I wrote it down in my resume that I studied time travelling concept given by Stephen Hawking. Because people don't want to listen a normal girl but ready to believe in Stephen Hawking whom they never met and never listen him. Just read his theory without understanding it and believe it properly without any questions and told me that "I am challenging a great scientist". Even I never told anyone that Stephen Hawking is wrong in his theory. I just said that I studied his theory and understand it and want to enhance it and make it practical if I got chance to work with NASA or get an opportunity to go in space and research about it and solve its mysterious things. 

But , right now I don't have anything to do as I have left my job from last 12 months and not able to find a single job in the whole world and as it's human tendency to think or to do some work . So, I am thinking that I should complete this article by today as I am free to think without any limitations and boundaries. But let me very clear to all readers that it is my hypothesis and my own imagination to teach you what Hawking may thought and I am not properly sure about it as I have never seen any planet except earth or space. Even I never get out from my home state(Haryana(Palwal), India) and I am writing this article sitting at my home locked in a room?

So, first understand what is black hole.

A black hole form or created when a star die and its gravity is so much high that light cannot escape from it even light has highest travelling speed which is 3 X 10^8 m/s known as highest speed that can cover around 15 X 10^7 kms distance in around 8 seconds. Now, the question is how a star die ?
A star is a celestial body having its own heat and light due to nuclear fusion reaction. When a star starting die then it goes bigger and bigger and biggest in terms of size , heat and light that other celestial body revolving around it will collapse into its center due to the gravitational force cause of having large size. Then it will cool down as its whole fuel will finish and shrink to a single point having a lots of gravitational force into it that if anything thrown into it , it will be shattered into pieces due to its speed and center force.

Lets understand star dying with an example. Suppose you have a candle. Lit that candle with some fire using match sticks. When you lit the candle , this is known as origin of star . When some energy is put on the matter it converted into star and it is done by nuclear fusion reaction. Now it will burn its cotton string constantly. When candle will about to finish , then pay attention towards its flame , It's burning on its high speed with a lot of light and heat. Then it slowly blown out. Same thing happen with the stars , when they are about to die ,then reaction goes abruptly very fast which results in increase in its size , light and heat and a lot of energy emission that celestial bodies which are around it collapse into it. Then it cools down and shrink into a single point which is called black hole.

Now, the question is how a black hole looks like ? you can assume a black hole as a gateway of tunnel which is moving with high speed. If you are still not able to imagine a black hole then think a whir-pool or moving water in washing machine is a black hole and an ant is human being entering into it. If you are still not able to imagine then let me give another example to imagine a black hole.

I hope , all of you have used mixer grinder in your krister rooms or seen females working with it. Now , let's try to understand what is black hole by making mango shake.Mango pulp , milk and ice etc which are ingredient of mango shake are the matter and blades of juicer moving with some velocity are the gravitational force which attract everything towards itself. When you switch on the mixer then whole ingredient crushes into small pieces even so much smaller that when you take out the juice you even cannot separate the mango pulp with ice cubes and milk . This is the main reason why light cannot escape from a black hole. 

But think... why it is happened ? I mean why ice cubes and mango pulp become liquid and be a part of it even black hole does not consist of any blades.Then how a matter shattered into pieces. Actually, it is because of inertia and speed gap between black hole rotational speed and gravitation and the matter which enter into it . When a matter enter into a black hole , then it cannot co-operate with the speed of black hole and move with its speed and the speed becomes so high the it make break it into its atomic parts. 

And , we can have idea of its speed by this that light cannot escape from it and trapped into it revolving with its speed which is an example of matter and having speed 3X10^8 m/s . It means black hole is moving with equal or higher speed than light. This is the main reason of not having any light in black hole and that's why it is called black.

Now, the question is... how we can meet our past or future through black hole. I know this is very obvious question. But I think, before asking this question , you should pay attention to the death of star which I elaborate so finely. Got the idea what I mean to say or not ?
ok fine ... I 'll try to make you understand this concept through my imagination.

Now, go back to death of star . When a star die , celestial bodies around it collapse into it. That means they are present in black hole but in what form , I cannot say as there are two probabilities. One :- if these celestial bodies have strong gravitation power and force of attraction and relative few slower speed to the black hole's speed then these bodies will not break into pieces and preserve their existence and revolving with the black hole with its speed as black hole don't have any blades like juicer. 

And second one is if these bodies are not strong enough then they will break into pieces and be a part of black hole.

Most of the time , it may be assumed that probability one is true as no celestial body is small like ant and no star like sun and there difference is very big and that poor small ant will breaks into atoms. But remember exceptions are always there. That means second probability can also be true.

Now, if we assume the first probability is true , then we can enter to that particular celestial body by entering into black hole with either its revolving speed or higher than its speed. That means we need to make something which have either the speed of light or higher than it so that relatively we are either in still position or going faster to it. So, in this way we can meet our past or future through black hole.

## '''How actually we can travel in time :-'''

I have already told you that all these things are my imaginations to connect things to the universe activities which may or may not be true as I have not seen any space except sun moon from and stars from earth. But still I believe that anything which are real in this world are concepts before. Take an example of mobiles and television and wireless communication and many more things. An ancient man cannot think of a communication like we used to do today's time. It's a magic for them or we are more advanced from them.

So may be the solution what I am thinking right now is just an idea or which is unfulfilled but may be it works or may be not. But still I cannot help myself without telling it ,so following are the steps :- 

First we need to find out the problems while going for time travelling.

## '''Problems :-'''

The main problem is to find whether such a galaxy exist which have copy of our earth and if it exists then what its location and how much far it is located from us.
Another main probability could be the planet which we are searching is situated in another solar system of our galaxy.

Second step is to have information about worm-holes and black holes. 

Third is to make advance space shuttle which can travel with speed of light or more of it. 

Then after it , forth step is to go there and have informations about it like its temperature , environment , time difference , speed and then 
travel in time.

## '''Solutions :-'''

## '''If planet is in our galaxy :-'''
If such type of planet is present in our galaxy then we can enter into it through the space shuttle if the star had been dead and became a black hole then we need a space shuttle with its rotational speed or higher than it.

## '''If planet is in another galaxy :-'''
If the planet is in another galaxy then we can enter into it first through worm hole to enter into that particular galaxy and then black hole to enter into desired particular planet.Let me remind you one thing that there could be space between two galaxies or may not be. If there is space then path followed from one galaxy worm hole to another galaxy worm hole is called imaginary tunnel or virtual tunnel.

## '''Strategy to solve this problem :-'''
There are about 10^11 galaxies in the universe and according to hubble's law they can be many more as universe is expanding. So, finding such a galaxy in quiet difficult. But being a computer scientist , I cannot help without giving solutions. So let's again imagine all the galaxies present in this space or universe as dots on a plane. Now, we need to have information about the space activities which is occurring and information about galaxies. For this, we need to create a network of our satellites in the space and this network should use hybrid topology to have the information about galaxies consisting of star and chain topology and each satellite information will be tracked and seen by use using RADAR based on radio wave detection. 

The whole system will like that a star should be connected to another star and chain goes on with radio waves links with some intersection between their communication zones so that they can transfer information to each other. And we get the information of through our nearest satellite which not only gives its own gathered information even give information of another satellite also on clicking the system.

There are many galaxies and solar systems in the space and we only know ourselves which is our initial point and have no any idea how far we need to go and where we should go. So Breadth first search will be better in this case i.e. going sequence wise and collecting informations about the space activities or forth and back algorithm will be good in which works on pendulum like on first day , go to left side from inital point then back to initial point then go right side from initial point and slowly slowly increase steps every time but this algo will be so much resource consuming and wasting them by coming back again and again.

Or there could be many more ideas to solve this problems .

But I think , there are many rules which will going to violate to implement this theory.

## '''Rules which are going to violate by time travelling concept :-'''

### '''Energy - Mass conservation Law :-'''
This law was given by Albert Einstein, according to which 
                                                            Energy = Mass X <sub>(speed of light)</sub>2

This law states that if any matter runs with the speed of light then it will be converted into energy. This means , right now the only matter which can enter into black hole is light nothing else which is also an example of energy in terms of heat. Even an electron cannot enter into a black hole as its speed is less then light which revolve around its nucleus and very negligible mass of 9.1 X <sub>10</sub>-31 kg.  

Right now, I don't think so we have so much advanced technology or any concept which make any matter to travel with speed of light without converting into energy.

So, I think half of the concept of time travelling goes down here and right now its not possible. But may be in future it could be possible one day as a lot of scientists and researchers are making their efforts so much. I hope that one day, time travelling will also be possible.
And the solution which I provide is so much costly in terms of money and effort as we need a advanced space shuttle which can travel with speed of light and network of satellites which works with the help of solar energy and have high capacity to store solar energy for the fuel and many purposes.
